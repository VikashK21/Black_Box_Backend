          service based solely in Bangalore and shall not give rise to personal
          jurisdiction over BlackBox, either specific or general, in
          jurisdictions other than Bangalore. These Terms of Service, together
          with the Privacy Policy and the other Governing Documents, shall all
          be governed and construed in accordance with the internal laws of
          Bangalore, State of Karnataka, India, without regard to conflicts of
          law principles. You agree that any legal action or proceeding between
          BlackBox and you for any purpose concerning these Terms of Service,
          the Privacy Policy, the other Governing Documents or your use of the
          Service shall be brought exclusively in a federal or state court of
          competent jurisdiction sitting in Bangalore, India.
          <br />
          <br />
          Any cause of action or claim you may have with respect to any of the
          foregoing matters must be commenced within one (1) year after the
          claim or cause of action arises or such claim or cause of action is
          barred.
          <br />
          <br />
          You and BlackBox agree that any dispute or claim arising from or
          relating to the Terms shall be finally settled by arbitration, using
          the English language. Our arbitration will be handled by a sole
          arbitrator in accordance with those rules. Judgment on the arbitration
          award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction. Any
          arbitration under the Terms will take place on an individual basis.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to
          bring an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or
          other equitable or conservatory relief, pending a final decision by
          the arbitrator.
          <br />
          <br />
          These Terms of Service, together with the Privacy Policy and the other
          Governing Documents, constitute the entire agreement between you and
          BlackBox concerning the Service and the services provided by BlackBox.
          If any provision of any such document is deemed invalid by a court of
          competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not
          affect the validity of the remaining provisions thereof, which shall
          remain in full force and effect. BlackBox's failure to insist upon or
          enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms of Service
          or any of the other Governing Documents shall not be construed as a
          waiver of any provision or right. Neither the course of conduct
          between the parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any
          provision of these Terms of Service. BlackBox may assign its rights
          and duties under these Terms of Service or any of the other Governing
          Documents to any party at any time without notice to you.
          <br />
          <br />
          Most communication between BlackBox and you will be sent and received
          electronically. You agree that all electronic communication between
          BlackBox and you shall satisfy any legal requirements that such
          communications be in writing.
