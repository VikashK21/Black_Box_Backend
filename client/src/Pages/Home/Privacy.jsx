          <h5>General</h5>
          Your privacy is very important to us. Accordingly, we have developed
          this Privacy Policy in order for you to understand how we collect,
          use, communicate and disclose and make use of Personal Data (as
          defined below). The following outlines our privacy policy.
        </Container>
        <Container className="px-5 py-3">
          <h5>EU Personal Data</h5>
          If you are located in the European Union ("EU"), United Kingdom,
          Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under
          the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR") with respect to
          your Personal Data, as outlined in the EU Privacy Notice.
        </Container>
        <Container className="px-5 py-3">
          <h5>School-based Users</h5>
          If you are a high school student and are accessing the Services
          through an account provided by your school (a School-based User”), you
          may only access the Services if you are at least 13 years old.
        </Container>
        <Container className="px-5 py-3">
          <h5>Personal Data</h5>
          When your register with us and become a BlackBox Member, when you
          choose to teach or attend a class, we will ask you for Personal Data.
          “Personal Data” refers to information about you that can be used to
          contact or individually identify you. This includes, but is not
          limited to, your name, email address, but does not include your credit
          card number or billing information. Transactions on BlackBox involving
          your billing and payment information are processed by PayPal and
          Stripe and are subject to their privacy policies. We do not store any
          of the credit card or banking information that you provide to these
          payment processors. In order to send you email from BlackBox, we need
          your email address. To provide you with additional services, we may
          also request your name, general location, and telephone number. We may
          give some or all of this information to the teachers for classes that
          you sign up for so that they can coordinate their classes. We will not
          give your name, email, or other Personal Data to unaffiliated third
          parties except with your consent or as otherwise set forth in this
          privacy policy. Though we employ industry standard measures to
          preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose Personal Data when
          required by law or when we have a good faith belief that such action
          is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court
          order or legal process that we receive or to protect our interests or
          the safety of others. In addition, we may provide Personal Data to
          employees, consultants or other business or persons for the purpose of
          processing such information on our behalf. In such circumstances, we
          require that these parties agree to protect the confidentiality of
          such information and to comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
          We may use your Personal Data to operate, improve, understand and
          personalize our Services.
        </Container>
        <Container className="px-5 py-3">
          <h5>Voluntary Disclosure</h5>
          Any Personal Data or content that you voluntarily disclose in public
          areas becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by
          other users for any reason. Your profile pages (“Profile”) and any
          online classrooms you participate in are typically publicly available.
          You have the ability to change your account settings to limit access
          to your profile, and may delete content you post to public classrooms.
          If you need assistance with controlling your account privacy settings
          or with deleting content, please contact us at __________________.
          Removal of posted content does not ensure complete or comprehensive
          removal of the content or information (e.g., some content may be
          “invisible” to other users but remain on our servers in some form).
          You should exercise caution before disclosing your Personal Data via
          these or any other public venues.
          <br />
          <br />
          For example, if you choose to sign up for a BlackBox account, you may
          have a Profile on the site, containing your full name and some basic
          information including your location and bio. You may also add
          additional optional information to your Profile. You may control what
          type of Profile information is shown to others through your Account
          Settings. Any information you choose to provide as part of your
          Profile should reflect how much you want other BlackBox users to know
          about you. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive
          information and we encourage members to think carefully about what
          information about themselves they disclose in their profile pages. You
          can review and revise your profile information at any time.
        </Container>
        <Container className="px-5 py-3">
          <h5>Children’s Privacy</h5>
          As noted in our Terms of Service, we do not knowingly collect or
          solicit Personal Data from anyone under the age of 18, unless you are
          a School-based User (as defined above). If you are under 18, please do
          not attempt to register for the Services or send any Personal Data
          about yourself to us unless you are a School-based User. If we learn
          that we have collected Personal Data from a child under age 18 who is
          not a School-based User, we will delete that information as quickly as
          possible. If you believe that a child under 18 may have provided us
          Personal Data, please contact us at _____________.

          <h5> Information About Cookies</h5>
          We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to
          administer our Services, and to analyze traffic patterns on the
          Services. The Services also use cookies and similar technologies such
          as pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, and JavaScript (collectively,
          “Cookies”) to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and
          tell us how and when you visit and use our Site and Services, to
          analyze trends, learn about our user base and operate and improve our
          Services. For example, we use Cookies to deliver content specific to
          your interests, to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it
          each time you visit, and to track whether emails we send you have been
          viewed. Cookies are small files – usually consisting of letters and
          numbers – placed on your computer, tablet, phone, or similar device
          when you use that device to visit our Site. We sometimes combine
          information collected through Cookies that is not Personal Data with
          Personal Data that we have about you, for example, to tell us who you
          are or whether you have an account with us. We may also supplement the
          information we collect from you with information received from third
          parties.
          <br />
          <br />
          Cookies can either be “session Cookies” or “persistent Cookies”.
          Session Cookies are temporary Cookies that are stored on your device
          while you are visiting our Site or using our Services, whereas
          “persistent Cookies” are stored on your device for a period of time
          after you leave our Site or Services. The length of time a persistent
          Cookie stays on your device varies from Cookie to Cookie. We use
          persistent Cookies to store your preferences so that they are
          available for the next visit, and to keep a more accurate account of
          how often you visit our Services, how often you return, how your use
          of the Services may vary over time. We also use persistent Cookies to
          measure the effectiveness of advertising efforts. Through these
          Cookies, we may collect information about your online activity after
          you leave our Services. Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” or
          “DNT” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites, and
          web applications, and services that you do not wish such operators to
          track certain of your online activities over time and across different
          websites. Because we collect browsing and persistent identifier data,
          the Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which
          means that we may collect information about your online activity both
          while you are using the Services and after you leave our properties.
          <br />
          <br />
          Some Cookies are placed by a third party on your device and may
          provide information to us and third parties about your browsing habits
          (such as your visits to our Site or Services, the pages you have
          visited and the links and advertisements you have clicked). These
          Cookies can be used to determine whether certain third party services
          are being used, to identify your interests, to retarget advertisements
          to you and to serve advertisements to you that we or others believe
          are relevant to you. We do not control third party Cookies.
          <br />
          <br />
          We use the following types of Cookies:

          websites or services, and you should review the privacy policy of each
          such website or service to make sure that you are comfortable with it

          As discussed above, we may give your Personal Data to the teachers for

          their classes. As part of our Terms of Use, BlackBox Teachers agree
          not to abuse other users' Personal Data. Abuse is defined as using
          Personal Data for any purpose other than those explicitly specified in
          the Teachers' Class. However, please understand that BlackBox Teachers
          are not our employees or consultants and that we are not party to any
